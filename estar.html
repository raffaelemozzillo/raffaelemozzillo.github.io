						<p>On February 2011 I joined the CubeSat Team of Politecnico di Torino. At the time, <strong>e-st@r-I</strong> CubeSat project was in Phase D, so my contribution has been very limited, while I took a role in Phase E (launch occurred on February 2012) for the operations.</br>On the other side, I have been deeply involved on <strong>e-st@r-II</strong> CubeSat project in all phases, and actually still I am! More info abot e-st@r-II are available <a href="http://areeweb.polito.it/cubesat-team/missions/e-star-ii/">here</a>. Be aware of possible slow loading. </br> My contributions are briefly described below.</p>

							<p>The desing of the subsystem was done by two radio-amateurs of Bra (currently they work at ESA as RF engineers), so my contribution is limited to soldering of SMD components and verification at subsystem level (e.g. signal analysis using oscilloscope) .</p>
							In addition, I was involved into the reworking of the antenna deployment system, which has changed considerably if compared to e-st@r-I, and reverse engineering of the e-st@r-I subsystem.

							<p>I was involved in all the activities concerning the assembly and integration (from component level up to system level) of the satellite and the verification: the contributions range from soldering to epoxy application, from single equipment test up to whole satellite verification. Among various activities, it is worth mentioning the <strong>functional test campaign</strong> at ambient condition conducted at Politecnico di Torino during 2014 and the <strong>environmental test campaign</strong> performed at ESA-ESTEC during 1Q-2Q of 2015. The first consists of basic and full functional tests and mission tests. The other instead consists of <strong>Vibration Tests</strong> (random, quasi-static, sinusoidal) and <strong>Thermal Vacuum Cycling Test</strong> (1 non-operative cycle and 3 operative cycles). For each test, a detailed as-run procedure was established and followed. To recap:
